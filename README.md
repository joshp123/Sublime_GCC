How to get Sublime Text 2 working with GCC
==========================================

Usage:
------

It's very simple: use **Control + B** when in Sublime Text 2 to compile and run your C file.

If there are errors compiling, these will show in the Sublime console window.

Installation Instructions
--------------------------

Extract the .zip, right click the setup.exe and click "Run as Administrator" (this is important), then follow the instructions.

If you don't have it already, the setup program will prompt you to download the .NET Framework 4.0, which is required to run this.


Known Issues:
-------------

- this doesn't work on cluster computers because no admin rights but a portable version of this is ~coming soon~
